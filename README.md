# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5

## 1) OVERVIEW OF THE ANALYSIS :

The purpose of the analysis is to create a summary dataframe that will show ride sharing data by city type (Rural, Urban & Sub-urban). We then will create a multiple line graph that shows total weekly fares by each city type. Using data visualization techniques, we give insight into the data from a ride sharing company called PyBer.

RESOURCES:

  * Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
  * Software: Python 3.6.9, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.7, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.1

## 2) RESULTS :

The following key metrics were calculated and a dataframe was created to observe and analyze the ride sharing data:
